VIER-EEN-TWEE

This project consists of 3 sub-folders:
I. System

Find inside:
 - all .h and .cpp files
 - relevant .txt files (which may also be found within the Data folder)
 - a Makefile
 - a Linux executable for ease of use

To start the running of the program, the user has 2 options:
   1. Simply run the executable.
   2. Compile and run the project manually.

    For the 2nd option: please do as follows:
     i. open the terminal in the Data folder
     ii. Execute the command make
     iii. Execute the command make run

One may observe the project in 2 ways:
   1. Run the basic function plainSeasonRun() to simulate a single run of the season. No strings attached.
   2. Run the function demoVersion() to interact with the program. This will execute step-by-step and allow the user to
      specify input as well as requesting differing levels detail in output from the program on a dynamic basis.


II. Data

Find inside:
 - raceData.txt - a file containing the data of the 21 races in a typical F1 season. The file's first line contains the
   number of races to be read in. It then follows the format:
    Name
    TrackComplexity
    In Europe or not
    Number of laps to be completed

- asciiRace.txt - a text file containing some spunky extras to jazz up the output. Cause console only takes you so far.

III. Report

Find inside:
 - A pdf file containing our final report
   Note: This file contains links to the following
    - The final Google Doc from which the pdf was generated
    - Other Google Docs used by smaller teams in the group to facilitate working together. (This is added in solely for
      purpose of the marker to observer participation)
    - A link to our git repository

- A folder named Diagrams.
    The folder contains 3 sub-folders each corresponding to a respective department. These then contain the pdf versions
    of all our generated diagrams so as to allow the marker to inspect more intensely our diagrams, should the Google
    Doc be insufficient for his/her needs.
